Requesting Mana
===============

If you would like Mana to be present in your channel, join the `#mana` channel in any of the [supported networks], and
ask away.

## Prerequisites

- Your channel is a [supported network].
- You are a operator of the channel.

Once Mana is your IRC channel, we request that you voice it (+v). This is a rule of some IRC networks[1].
