The bridge Module Rules
=======================

To prevent abuse of Mana, I have compiled a list of reasons why Mana why be removed from a channel. However it is 
completely up to us to decide on a case-by-case basis.

- Do not spam channels of which the bridge module is active<br>
  Users who do this, will find themselves ignored by Mana.<br>
  If a channel has too much spam it will have the bridge module disabled and Mana removed from the channel.
