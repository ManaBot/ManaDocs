The History of Mana
===================

Mana first started off as LexBot, which was just a user on a bouncer ([YourBNC]) making the occasional message regarding
pushing to GitHub repositories.

After the demise of YourBNC, Lexbot disappeared and hasn't made announcements of pushes to GitHub since.

Then in early 2016, I started [TheStig] originally made to log some IRC channels it soon had it's `bridge` module
made specifically for the `#paper` channel.

However because it had a half-finished logging system in place alongside some rather rushed code, I was quick to stop
developing it.

Atleast until I heard kashike was rewriting the [Korobi] bot, I thought it was about time I rewrote TheStig - do I did.

The day after rewriting it I decided it was time to give it a new name, so rather than going to my usual inspiration 
(flowers, fruits, etc) I decided to go with the same inspiration as Korobi: the name of a character from one of my 
favourite animes. Problem was - I'be only watched one, but on the bright side it was a good one! So there I had it I 
need a character from Yu-Gi-Oh. It was shortly after I picked [Mana].
