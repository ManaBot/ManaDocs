Mana Documentation
==================

## Introduction

Welcome to the ManaDocs, home to the documentation of the Mana IRC Bot.

We are committed to open-source software and as such some of Mana is open-source on our [GitHub organisation].

## What is Mana

The Mana IRC Bot is an all new IRC Bot, and the successor to TheStig IRC Bot.
It's current functionality is: 

- Bridging IRC channels (cross-network)

However Mana's development has always been guided by the community, so feel free to drop into the `#mana` channel
on any IRC network where the Mana IRC bot is present to give us your suggestions.
